## üèãÔ∏è Pulling the Model
You can clone the pre-trained model showen in the workshop to play around with directly from **Hugging Face** using:

```bash
 git clone https://huggingface.co/Hamze-Hammami/AI-Workshop-models-E4L
```

Alternatively, you can go directly to the models on **Hugging Face**:

## üöÄ Running Training Scripts
You can run the training scripts either **locally on a Jupyter Notebook** or on Google Colab:

[![Open in Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1AJcaxH2Tx6PEU5UHtRBX6ACOhllukigM?usp=sharing)

For local execution, open the script in a notebook:

```python
scripts/train.ipynb
```
